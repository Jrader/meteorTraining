1.) Three connections were required to communicate over UART.

2.) The purpose of the alternate functions were so we could take a function as 
    an input and return that specific function's output.

3.) Baud rate is the speed that information is transfered in a specific channel

4.) We need newlib_stubs so we can access the standard C library. Without it,
    we can only use the functions that the arm recognizes.

I learned how to use the UART along with the Logic Analyzer. We had difficulty
with getting serialT to run, but once we readjusted how our wires were setup,
we were able to get it working.
