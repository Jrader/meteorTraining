Final Project
Joey Rader- jcrader
Di Zhong- dizhong

The core functionality of the game is to move the cursor around on the screen
to shoot the square. As time decreases, the more points you're going to 
receive for hitting the square. There is also a end game screen that displays
a high score and allows you to play again if you want to. I handled most of 
the nunchuk movement and initial screen display. Di handled the sounds, 
modified screen displays, and high score display. The main problem we had was
with bmp images. We ended up just mannually drawing everything we needed since
we couldn't get them to load properly. If I could start the project over, 
I would put more time into getting the bmp images to load properly.
